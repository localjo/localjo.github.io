# Get in touch!

I'm interested in working with teams that have a mission or product I'm passionate about.

I'm especially interested in working on projects related to _humanitarian causes_, _the environment_, _science_ and _travel_.

Right now I'm based the the **GMT timezone**, authorized to work for US-based companies, and open to **remote opportunities**. If you have an opportunity you'd like to discuss with me, please send me an email: [web@iamlocaljo.com](mailto:web@iamlocaljo.com).
