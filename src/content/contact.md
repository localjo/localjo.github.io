# Get in touch!

I'm interested in working with teams that have a mission or product I'm passionate about.

I'm especially interested in working on projects related to _humanitarian causes_, _the environment_, _science_ and _travel_.

I'm open to **remote opportunities**, authorized to work in the US and Europe, and spend most of my time in European and Asian timezones. If you have an opportunity you'd like to discuss with me, please send me an email: [web@josprague.com](mailto:web@josprague.com).
